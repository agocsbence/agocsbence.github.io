I've attached a copy of my resume detailing my experience, along with a link to my basic portfolio website, where you can find websites and applications I've had a honor of working on.

I'm an experienced front-end developer, based in Budapest, Hungary. My core skills are in semantic HTML & CSS, progressively enhanced JS, Wordpress templating, Vue.js & React, static site generation and generally putting the user first. I believe in continuous development and I seek pixel perfect precision. I understand and know how to implement an application - from UX to front-end development, but I prefer focussing my energy on design work and site-building.
